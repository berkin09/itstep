        <h2 class="subtitle-1">ACT 1</h2>
        <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
        <p>
          Two households, both alike in dignity, <br />
          In fair Verona where we lay our scene, <br />
          From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br />
          Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br />

          From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br />
          A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life; <br />
          Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br />
          Doth, with their death, bury their parents' strife. <br />

          The fearful passage of their death-marked love, <br />
          And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br />
          Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br />
          Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br />

          The which, if you with patient ears attend, <br />
          What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
        </p>
